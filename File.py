    File
    ==========
    
    Handle Files most common operations.

    Attributes
    ----------
        path (str): Path of the File
        name (str): Name of the file without it's extension
        ext (str): File Extension (Format type)

    Methods
    -------
        isfile() -> bool:
            returns True if the path belongs to an existing file,
            else (Folder or non-existant File) it returns False

        exist() -> bool:
            returns True if file exists in the system else returns False

        size() -> int:
            returns the size of the file in bytes

        isvalid(valid_types: list | tuple | set) -> bool:
            Check if the File format is supported by passing an iterable contains the supported types
        
        dir() -> str:
            Returns File Directory
        
        validate_name() -> None:
            Modifying the instance's file name for the following reasons:
                - if there is another file within the same folder that has the same name
                - the file name doesn't met the system naming convention
        
        remove() -> bool:
            Remove the File from the main system if existed
            
            **only delete Files**
            
            **Note** file will be permanently deleted and can't be restored
            
            **Restriction:** The file will only be deleted if it is located within the application's 
            current working directory or one of its subdirectories.
